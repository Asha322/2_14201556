In my solution I implemented a main class Hand, which contains the methods common for all games: 
complete?, contains?, add_value(c) and value(c).
As games Spider and Light are played with 5 cards in hand and Idiot and Liar are played with 2 cards in hand,
I decided to make 2 classes inheriting hand - Hand_2cards and Hand_5cards, and then the four classes inherit
from them. The problem is that both classes inheriting Hand_2cards and one class inheriting Hand_5cards
have the same way of evaluating the hand, so there's no point in rewriting this method, on the other hand, the Spider game
has an absolutely different way of doing it. So I created a module with a method common for three classes and
included it in them.
